# Line-Following-Robot
A line-following robot, also known as a line follower is a robot car that autonomously follow a visible line on the ground or surface i.e. dark coloured line over a light surface.

Components Needed:

1.Robot Chassis: A platform or frame to hold the components.

2.Microcontroller: Arduino Uno.

3.Line Sensors: Infrared or reflective sensors to detect the line.

4.Motor Driver: To control the robot's motors (L293D).

5.Motors and Wheels: To move the robot.

6.Power Source: Batteries to power the robot.

Steps to Build:

1.Assemble the Chassis: Set up the physical structure of the robot where you will mount the motors, wheels, and other components.

2.Attach Motors and Wheels: Attach the motors to the chassis and connect them to the motor driver.

3.Connect Line Sensors: Attach the line sensors beneath the robot, facing the ground. These sensors will detect the line.

4.Wire the Circuit: Connect the sensors, motors, and motor driver to the microcontroller as per their specifications

5.Code: Dump the source code into the microcontroller
